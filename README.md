# Mixed domain demos
This repository contains examples of how mixed-domain problems can be solved in FEniCSx.

NOTE: Mixed-domain functionality in FEniCSx is under active development and is **not** ready for production use.

# Running the demos
The mixed-domain features will be in the next FEniCSx release (v0.9).

The demos can be run now by installing the main development branches of each of the FEniCSx components:
- basix: [main](https://github.com/FEniCS/basix)
- UFL: [main](https://github.com/FEniCS/ufl)
- FFCx: [main](https://github.com/FEniCS/ffcx)
- dolfinx: [main](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx)

Alternatively, you can use docker:
`docker run -ti dolfinx/dolfinx:nightly`
