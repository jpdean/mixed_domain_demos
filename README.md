# Mixed domain demos
This repository contains examples of how mixed-domain problems can be solved in FEniCSx.

NOTE: Mixed-domain functionality in FEniCSx is under active development and is **not** ready for production use.

# Running the demos
The demos in this repository currently require FEniCSx main to run. After the 0.10.0 release of DOLFINx, I will update and tidy the demos and start tagging with release numbers.
